  <h1>A quick read before your last lesson</h1>

  <div class="letter">
    <p><strong>Just this.</strong></p>

    <p>
      You didn’t have to go through all of this. You could’ve stopped at any point.
      Skipped things. Walked away.
    </p>

    <p>
      But you didn’t. And honestly, I knew you wouldn’t.
    </p>

    <p>
      If there’s anyone in this world I trust to patiently sit through every bit of my silliness,
      it’s you.
    </p>

    <p>
      The way you stay. The way you try, even when it isn’t easy.
      The way you show up, every single time.
    </p>

    <p>
      You make a home for me.<br>
      And I notice all of it. I really do.
    </p>

    <p>
      If love is effort, patience, consistency, and choosing someone again and again,
      then you’ve been loving me all along.
    </p>

    <p>
      So this isn’t a reward for finishing games.
      It’s a thank you for being you.
    </p>

    <p>
      For staying kind.<br>
      For staying mine.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m grateful for your love.
      And I’m really, really glad it’s yours that I get to keep.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Happy Valentine’s Day ❤️</strong></p>
